## Overview

Degen Cash (DC) is a privacy-focused financial system built on Solana using Arcium's encrypted computation framework. The core innovation is an **encrypted and unknown peg ratio** between DC tokens and USDC reserves, with the system automatically minting and burning DC through user transactions to maintain balance.

**Key Features:**
- Encrypted global state using Arcium Multi-Party Computation (MPC)
- Unknown DC-to-USDC peg ratio (NAV) stored in encrypted context
- Socialized gains/losses distributed across all DC holders
- Privacy-preserving transfers with configurable variance and randomness
- Multiple financial products built on the same encrypted state

---

## Core Concept

### Encrypted NAV (Net Asset Value)

The system maintains an encrypted peg ratio between DC and USDC reserves:

```
NAV% = (Total DC Supply / USDC Reserves) Ã— 100
```

This ratio is **never revealed** to users and is stored in Arcium's MPC context (`Enc<Mxe, u64>`), ensuring:
- Users cannot know the true value of their DC holdings
- The system can obfuscate value transfers through randomness
- Privacy is maintained through encrypted computation

### Socialized Wins & Losses

Every transaction creates variance between what senders pay and what receivers get:

- **Social Win (Individual Loss)**: Sender pays more than receiver gets â†’ DC is burned, benefiting all holders
- **Social Loss (Individual Win)**: Sender pays less than receiver gets â†’ DC is minted, diluting all holders

This mechanism distributes transaction costs and gains across the entire ecosystem while maintaining privacy.

---

## Architecture

### Arcium Encryption Contexts

The system uses two types of encrypted contexts:

1. **`Enc<Mxe, u64>`** - Multi-Party Execution Context
   - Stores the global DC mint amount (total supply)
   - Accessible only through Arcium MPC nodes
   - Represents system-wide encrypted state
   - Used for: Global DC supply tracking

2. **`Enc<Shared, u64>`** - User Shared Context
   - Stores individual user DC balances
   - Encrypted but accessible to the specific user
   - Privacy-preserving per-user state
   - Used for: User account balances

### Technology Stack

- **Solana**: Layer 1 blockchain
- **Anchor**: Solana program framework
- **Arcium**: Encrypted computation and MPC network
- **Rust**: Smart contract implementation language

## Products

### Degen Base

**Status:** âœ… Complete

The foundational product enabling private DC token management with variance-based transfers.

#### Features

- âœ… Initialize Global DC Mint
- âœ… Create DC Token Accounts
- âœ… Deposit USDC â†’ Mint DC
- âœ… Transfer DC with variance
- âœ… Withdraw DC â†’ Burn for USDC
- âœ… Check Balance (client-side only)

#### Transfer Mechanics

The transfer function enables **private, obfuscated value transfers** with dynamic pricing based on variance selection and system health.

##### Core Guarantees

1. **Receiver Guarantee**: Always receives exactly `transfer_amount`
2. **Sender Variance**: Chooses `max_variance` (0-255) determining:
   - Maximum cost uncertainty (higher = more variance)
   - Fee rate: `(255 - max_variance)` basis points
   - Example: `max_variance=0` â†’ 255 bps (2.55%) fee
   - Example: `max_variance=255` â†’ 0 bps fee

##### Cost Calculation Process

**Step 1: Random Cost Adjustment**
- System samples random number (0 to `max_variance`)
- Random boolean determines direction (+/-)
- If TRUE: `sender_cost = transfer_amount - (transfer_amount Ã— variance_roll / 255)`
- If FALSE: `sender_cost = transfer_amount + (transfer_amount Ã— variance_roll / 255)`

**Step 2: NAV-Based Adjustment**
- `NAV% = (DC Supply / USDC Reserves) Ã— 100`
- If NAV < 100%: Sender gets discount of `(100 - NAV%)` basis points
- If NAV > 100%: Sender pays penalty of `NAV%` basis points

**Step 3: Socialized Difference**
- Difference between sender cost and receiver amount adjusts global DC supply
- `sender_cost < transfer_amount` â†’ DC minted (social loss)
- `sender_cost > transfer_amount` â†’ DC burned (social win)

##### Safety Mechanisms

- Pre-flight check: Sender must cover worst-case `transfer_amount + max_variance + fee`
- If actual cost > balance: Sender balance zeroed (no revert)
- Overflow protection on receiver balance
- Rejection sampling for secure randomness (max 10 attempts)

##### Status Codes

- `0`: Success
- `1`: Math Overflow
- `2`: Insufficient Funds (worst-case check failed)
- `3`: RNG Failure (couldn't generate valid random in 10 attempts)

##### Privacy & Obfuscation

The variance mechanism serves multiple purposes:
- **Value Obfuscation**: True transfer costs are unknown to observers
- **Privacy Incentive**: Users can pay fees via variance uncertainty instead of fixed costs
- **Network Effect**: Higher variance â†’ lower fees, but more unpredictability

### Degen Escrow (Coming Soon)

**Status:** ðŸš§ Planned

A time-locked escrow system with multi-party release conditions and burn mechanics.

#### Planned Features

- **Create Escrow**: Lock DC with configurable timer and release conditions
- **Multi-Party Release**: Define required parties who must approve release
- **Conditional Unlock**: Release funds to specific user if threshold met
- **Burn on Timeout**: If timer expires without release, funds are burned (social win)

#### Use Cases

- Conditional payments and agreements
- Multi-signature treasury management
- Dead man's switch mechanisms
- Social penalty for failed agreements

---

### Degen Lottery (Coming Soon)

**Status:** ðŸš§ Planned

A provably fair lottery system where ticket sales are burned and winners claim from a fixed prize pool.

#### Planned Mechanics

**Setup:**
- Admin creates lottery: 500 tickets @ $10 each = $5,000 collected
- All collected DC is **immediately burned** (social win)
- Prize pool set to $5,000 (separate from burned DC)

**Daily Drawing:**
- 5 random tickets selected on-chain
- Winner options:
  - Hold all 5 winning tickets â†’ Claim full $5,000
  - Hold 1+ winning tickets â†’ Redeem each for $20

#### Deflationary Design

- Ticket sales burn DC (reduces supply)
- Prize pool is fixed and separate from burned DC
- Net effect: More DC burned than minted, benefiting all holders

```bash
arcium test
```

This command:
- Starts a local Arcium MPC network (via Docker)
- Spins up a Solana test validator with Arcium program deployed
- Runs the full test suite in `tests/degen_cash.ts`
- Tests all encrypted instructions (deposit, transfer, withdraw)

#### Test Coverage

The `degen_cash.ts` test suite validates:
- âœ… Global DC mint initialization
- âœ… User DC account creation
- âœ… USDC deposits and DC minting
- âœ… Variance-based transfers with randomness
- âœ… Withdrawals and DC burning
- âœ… Balance tracking and consistency
